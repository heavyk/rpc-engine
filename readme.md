# RPC
Minimalist RPC library.

## Why
Other stuff seems really intent on making serialization or transport decisions for me.

## How
Based loosely on [JSON-RPC](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification).

## Example
See the [tests](https://github.com/jessetane/rpc/blob/master/test.js).

## Test
``` bash
$ npm run test
```
